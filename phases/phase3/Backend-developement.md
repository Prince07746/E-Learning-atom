**Project Documentation: Phase 3**

---

## **Objective**
To enhance the application by setting up a Spring Boot project that includes authentication and authorization, user and course management, subscription tracking, certificate generation, and discussion forums.

---

## **Phase 3 Deliverables**

### 1. **Set Up Spring Boot Project**
- **Dependencies:**
    - Spring Web
    - Spring Data JPA
    - Spring Security
    - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
    - H2/MySQL Database
    - Lombok
    - Thymeleaf (optional for admin panels)
    - Maven or Gradle as the build tool

- **Project Structure:**
  ```plaintext
  src/main/java/com/example/project
  |-- controller
  |-- service
  |-- repository
  |-- model
  |-- config
  |-- dto
  ```

- **Setup Steps:**
    1. Initialize the project with Spring Initializr.
    2. Configure `application.properties` or `application.yml` with database and security settings.
    3. Ensure the environment is set up for local development (e.g., installing Java 17, Maven/Gradle).

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization with JWT**
- **Goals:** Secure endpoints using JWT for authentication and role-based access control.
- **Implementation:**
    1. Configure Spring Security with a `SecurityConfig` class.
    2. Create a `User` entity and `Role` entity.
    3. Implement a JWT utility class for token generation, validation, and parsing.
    4. Develop login and register endpoints.
    5. Apply role-based authorization annotations (e.g., `@PreAuthorize`).

- **Key Endpoints:**
    - `POST /auth/register`
    - `POST /auth/login`

---

### 3. **Develop RESTful APIs**

#### **a. User Management**
- **Endpoints:**
    - `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user.
    - `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate and return JWT.
    - `GET /users` - List all users (admin only).
    - `GET /users/{id}` - Get user details.

- **Roles:** Admin, Instructor, Student.
- **Features:** Role-based access control for each endpoint.

#### **b. Course Management**
- **Endpoints:**
    - `GET /courses` - List all courses.
    - `POST /courses` - Add a new course (instructor/admin only).
    - `PUT /courses/{id}` - Update course details.
    - `DELETE /courses/{id}` - Delete a course (admin only).
    - `POST /courses/{id}/lessons` - Add lessons to a course.

- **Features:**
    - CRUD operations for courses.
    - Each course can include multiple lessons.

#### **c. Subscription Management**
- **Endpoints:**
    - `POST /subscriptions` - Subscribe to a course.
    - `GET /subscriptions` - List user subscriptions.
    - `POST /subscriptions/{id}/payments` - Record a payment.

- **Features:**
    - Track user progress.
    - Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).

#### **d. Certificate Generation**
- **Endpoints:**
    - `GET /certificates/{id}` - Generate a certificate for completed courses.

- **Features:**
    - Automatically generate certificates after course completion.
    - Use a library like iText or Apache PDFBox.

#### **e. Discussion Forums and Feedback**
- **Endpoints:**
    - `POST /forums/{courseId}/posts` - Create a new discussion post.
    - `GET /forums/{courseId}/posts` - Retrieve all posts for a course.
    - `POST /feedback` - Submit feedback.

- **Features:**
    - Students can create posts and reply to others.
    - Feedback collection for courses.

---

## **Testing and Deployment**
- **Testing:**
    - Write unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito.
    - Test security aspects thoroughly to ensure endpoints are protected.

- **Deployment:**
    - Use tools like Docker and Kubernetes for containerization.
    - Deploy on a cloud platform such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add a notification system for course updates and subscription reminders.
- Integrate a chatbot for user queries.
- Implement advanced analytics for user activity.
